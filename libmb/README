This is library minibox, where all commonly used function for programs are stored
that makes the code reusable, smaller, more efficient, and ultimatly faster.

------------ What is the purpose of this library you may ask? -----------

  The purpose of this library is to include as many commonly used functions as possible
  so that the repetition of commonly used function doesn't increase the executable's size.

  The general idea is to resuse/share common code with programs. This procedure can prove
  beneficial, BusyBox and ToyBox use this technique. Most of the time, programs need 
  to parse command line options like -a, -h, -v, etc. Many programs use the same option
  parsing code described below.

        +---------------------------------------+
        |                                       |
        |   // Option parser                    |
        |   for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {    |
        |     if (argc[i][0] == '-') {          |
        |       /~/~/~/ parse /~/~/~/~/         |
        |       if (!strcmp.......)             |
        |     }                                 |
        |   }                                   |
        |                                       |
        +---------------------------------------+

Each program uses the same code over and over again which makes the compiler think that the
whole parsing code is different in every file but in reality it is not, the linker on the other
hand can optimize for all files to use 1 function called again and again only if the objects are
linked with the function stored in a seperate file. In simple terms, gcc cannot optimize code
to be reused, but the linker can optimize the function object to be reused so why not make
a library where that option parsing code is stored and the linker can link that function's object
to the program object, then the linker at the end can make those object reuse code, sorry if you
cannot understand what I said, try asking ChatGPT about it :) .

------------- STANDALONE COMPILATION ---------------

If you are in the case of trying to compile a program standalone without relying on 
minibox and its library, you may freely and absolutely copy and paste the function's 
code that the program relys on into the program from this library source.
