This projects aims to be small and efficient, enough to be suitable for micro-embedded systems or just a 
busybox or toybox replacement, though this project lacks (many) options (-l, -v, -n) its core functionality
(without options) is compatible with other commands and not for some.

This project is simple and self-explanitory enough that you can implement your own command set!
