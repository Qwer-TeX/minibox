# MiniBox
A very young, almost unstable, busybox-like/toybox-like lighweight replacement aiming to be lightweight and ultra-portable

MiniBox - 


FEATURES (are there any?): 

 - No error checking
 - No debug
 - No real case uses (idk any - maybe embedded projects ? or learning C ???)
 - No useless symboles injected into objects
 - Only simplicity and low memory usage


NOTES for the public

  I know (maybe) that this project would not succeed against BusyBox or 
  ToyBox(as of right now). Almost same multi-call binary that you can't even show 
  the difference from, only which has the most arguments(-h, -v, etc).
