# MiniBox
A very young, almost unstable, busybox-like/toybox-like lighweight replacement aiming to be lightweight and ultra-portable

MiniBox - 

![MINIBOX-wTitle](https://github.com/Qwer-TeX/minibox/assets/128016252/df4b6b83-2adf-434a-9d46-a907a9641a51)

FEATURES (are there any?): 

 - No error checking
 - No debug
 - No real case uses (idk any - maybe embedded projects ? or learning C ???)

 - No useless symboles injected into objects
 - Only simplicity and low memory usage
 - Best of all, no bloat, anykind, source-code bloat, object bloat, etc.


NOTES for the public

  I know (maybe) that this project would not succeed against BusyBox or 
  ToyBox(as of right now). Almost same multi-call binary that you can't even show 
  the difference from, only which has the most arguments(-h, -v, etc).
