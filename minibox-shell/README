This is where the shell source is stored. There are examples in this directory to 
help make understanding how the shell works easier. The real shell minibox-shell.c
is not as advance as busybox ash, dash, or bash. If you expect a shell with all 
features, don't go which this one. 

If you expect a simple, plain shell without the shell programming functions, 
advanced variable expansion, brace expansion, and shell arithmetic, then go with this
but do remember that this is still beta and most importantly, if you see anything broken,
TELL ME, create a issue in my repository and we'll go from there.
