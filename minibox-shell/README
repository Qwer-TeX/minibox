example.c:  The original barebones shell without variable expansion, cursor navigation, etc.

example2.c: Imporved version of the barebones shell but with the help of libreadline which
            makes it now support variable expansion, cursor navigation, and history management.
            though it still doesn't support redirection. Is linking a small shell with a huge
            bloated libreadline make any sense? It looks like to me its some black magic dealing
            with terminals. Approx 30K lines of code for libreadline and also 20K for 
            libeditline, are you kidding me, its the most bloated libraries I've ever seen in my
            life.

readline_example: A simple lightweight example of how readline works.

NOTE:       Making a real shell involves more just than variable expansion, history management, 
            and cursor management, etc. It also needs to be able to run shell scripts. These 
            examples don't implement if, else, case, until, for, set, shopt, echo, etc although
            it includes export and cd.
